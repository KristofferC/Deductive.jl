Welcome to the Deductive Documentation!

!!! note
    As of now these docs are mainly for advanced users, as many of the user-facing features are not ready for release yet. Take a look at Deductive's [README](https://github.com/ctrekker/Deductive.jl) for a basic introduction to the stable front-facing user features.

## Installation

Open up a Julia REPL, press the character `]` to enter package manager mode, and type the following command:

```julia-repl
pkg> add Deductive
```

## Basic Usage

The best way to get accustomed to the syntax of Deductive is to start with [Propositional Logic](@ref).
